# VEHICLES

 This hobby project is an (ongoing) implementation of the vehicles described in the book "Vehicles - Experiments in Synthetic Psychology" written by Valentino Braitenberg.
 
 Currently it is only a prototype/proof-of-concept, closely following the book and showcasing some of the simple examples mentioned in it.
 
 It currently only supports creation of simple threshold devices, and includes placeholders for sensors and actuators in order to provide input and get output to/from threshold devices.
 
 As a bonus a graph generator is implemented to visualize the created threshold devices. Nodes and the connections in the device are outputted in DOT language and rendered with graphviz.
